This post is a reminder to myself.

I've started blogs, private journals, email threads, subreddits, many times over, and never stuck to them. However, as time goes by, I've accumulated a series of reasons to write more, and I'm listing them here as a self-motivation tool for when I notice myself dragging my feet on adding content to this website.

## Review

Writing helps place memories into context. Whether it's a book I read, a place I went to, or a thing I did, it helps to mentally go over it, gather my thoughts, and condense the most salient aspects of my experience together into a narrative. It's a reflective process that lets me understand what happened, what I learnt from it, and what I felt about it.

## Remember

There is no way to remember every books I've read, each of the places I've been, or all of the ideas I've had, without a record. Photos, though useful, certainly don't capture all of this information. Jotting down an account after the fact helps me revisit the experience and reference it in the future.

## Feedback

There's nothing like writing to force me to get to the point. It may be that I was mistaken, my idea bad, or that I haven't really understood something I thought I did at all. Having a clear and concise description of my thoughts gives me a tool to get feedback that helps me correct my mistakes and learn something new.  

I'd like to end with a quote by [Leslie Lamport](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport) that's driven me on this and which I hope will continue to inspire me:
