&lt;p&gt;This post is a reminder to myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve started blogs, private journals, email threads, subreddits, many times over, and never stuck to them. However, as time goes by, I&amp;rsquo;ve accumulated a series of reasons to write more, and I&amp;rsquo;m listing them here as a
 self-motivation tool for when I notice myself dragging my feet on adding content to this website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;review&#34;&gt;Review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing helps place memories into context. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s a book I read, a place I went to, or a thing I did, it helps to mentally go over it, gather my thoughts, and condense the most salient aspects of my experience
 together into a narrative. It&amp;rsquo;s a reflective process that lets me understand what happened, what I learnt from it, and what I felt about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;remember&#34;&gt;Remember&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no way to remember every books I&amp;rsquo;ve read, each of the places I&amp;rsquo;ve been, or all of the ideas I&amp;rsquo;ve had, without a record. Photos, though useful, certainly don&amp;rsquo;t capture all of this information. Jotting down a
n account after the fact helps me revisit the experience and reference it in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;feedback&#34;&gt;Feedback&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s nothing like writing to force me to get to the point. It may be that I was mistaken, my idea bad, or that I haven&amp;rsquo;t really understood something I thought I did at all. Having a clear and concise description
of my thoughts gives me a tool to get feedback that helps me correct my mistakes and learn something new.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;d like to end with a quote by &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport&#34;&gt;Leslie Lamport&lt;/a&gt; that&amp;rsquo;s driven me on this and which I hope will continue to inspire me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you think without writing, you only think you&amp;rsquo;re thinking. &amp;ndash; Leslie Lamport&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
