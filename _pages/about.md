I'm a software engineer and computer science geek with an avid interest in reading about anything under the sun. I'm based out of Northern California, and I set up this blog to journal my experiences and polish my writing skills. If you're looking for my professional information, see [my LinkedIn page](http://in.linkedin.com/in/KashyapTumkur).
